# Election Analysis

## Summary
I used Python to analyze the data from a .csv file containing all of the votes for the election. I counted the total votes, came up with a list of candidates, and figure out how many votes each candidate got. I also found the percetange each candidate received and finally wrote code to figure out the winner.

##Results
After running the code I found that Diana DeGette was the winner of the election with 272,892 votes. She received 73.8% of the total votes.
